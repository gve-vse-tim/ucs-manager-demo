# ucs-manager-demo

Ansible playbook, plays, and roles for pre-staging UCS Platform Emulator (UCSPE) environment for high level UCSM demonstrations as well as showing the automation and programmability of the UCS environment.

## Reference Material

- [UCS Platform Emulation 4.0(4ePE1)[https://community.cisco.com/t5/unified-computing-system/cisco-ucs-platform-emulator-4-0-4epe1/ta-p/3953328]: Site of the UCSPE that has the entire control plane of a UCS Manager environment (the brains of a UCS FI) and enough hardware emulation to showcase management, policies, and operations.
- [Cisco UCS Manager Ansible Git Repository](https://github.com/CiscoUcs/ucsm-ansible): Contains actively developed UCSM Ansible modules that have not yet been included in Ansible proper
- [Ansible Git Repository](https://github.com/ansible/ansible): Latest Ansible code not yet (necessarily) published to PyPI
- [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/): A data science focused distribution of Python. I use this because of my scientific background ***and*** because it provides a great means of installing an up-to-date Python distribution without affecting the local system's Python installation (which is sometimes tied to a lot of system tools).
